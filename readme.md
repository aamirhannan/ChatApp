Real time chat applciation using Node.Js and Socket.io


In this project, I have build a real time chat application that allows users to communicate with each other instantly. 

I have used Node.js as the backend framework and Socket.io as the library for enabling real time communication. 

Node.js is a JavaScript runtime environment that can handle concurrent requests efficiently. 

Socket.io is a library that enables bidirectional and event-based communication between the server and the client. 

By using these technologies, we can create a chat application that supports multiple rooms, private messages, emojis, and more.


#Setup
1. npm install express
2. npm install socket.io
3. npm run dev
